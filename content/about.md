Hi! I'm Heidi. Full Stack Developer and former Bioscientist.

I started my career as a bioscientist, but doing image and data analysis I quickly came to appreciate just how much software and coding skills can aid us. So started my journey deeper into the world of computers, mind you I had some small casual interest from before. But as it often is, one needs some sort of a push to change directions in life. Web development is my center of interest, I like the idea of cross-platform development, which web technology like Javascript and .NET Core enables me to do. I also like making solutions that make the everyday a bit life easier.

I enjoy new challenges and continuous learning. My core strengths are great organizational and communication skills as well as ability to learn new things fast.
